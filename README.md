# sentiment

A small sandbox repo for experimenting with sentiment analysis workflows.

## Goals

- Provide a clean place to prototype sentiment scoring and evaluation.
- Keep examples small and reproducible.

## Suggested structure

- `src/` — library / core logic
- `scripts/` — one-off experiments
- `data/` — local datasets (generally gitignored)
- `tests/` — unit tests

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Add your first implementation under `src/`.
3. Add a simple CLI or script under `scripts/`.

## License

Add a license when you’re ready to publish/distribute code.
